In this module we are learning about JPA(Java Persistence API)

JPA is a interface/contract while Hibernate is its implementation.
Hibernate is a default implementation of JPA but there are also other
implementations like EclipseLink or OpenJPA.

JPA is only for sql databases not for no-sql databases.


imp
NOTE: SpringBoot and Hibernate creates beans/object using default constructor
      so it is important to have default constructor along with parametrized constructor
